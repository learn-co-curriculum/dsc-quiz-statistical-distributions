# Statistical Distributions

While we recommend using Python to find the answers to these questions, it is not required. You are more than welcome to use a calculator or pencil and paper to solve them, too.

# Quiz - Statistical Distributions

?: Which of the following scenarios is described by a Bernouilli distribution?

( ) The outcome of rolling a fair die.
( ) The number of snail mail items received by a household per week.
( ) The distribution of the weights of newborns in the United States in 2018.
(X) Whether students pass or fail a course.

?: Which of the following statements about the standard normal distribution are true?

[X] The area under the standard normal distribution is equal to 1.
[X] The mean of the standard normal distribution is equal to 0.
[ ] The standard normal distribution is not symmetric around the mean.
[X] The mean, median, and mode of a standard normal distribution are equal.

?: Which of the following statements about samples and populations are true?

[X] A representative sample accurately represents the population.
[ ] The numbers you obtain when using a population are called statistics.
[ ] The numbers you obtain when using a sample are called parameters.
[X] A random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance.

?: What steps do you need to take to standardize a normally distributed variable $x$ with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$?

( ) First, divide all values in $x$ by the standard deviation $\sigma$. Then, substract the mean $\mu$ from all values.
( ) Divide all values in $x$ by the standard deviation $\sigma$. 
( ) Subtract the mean $\mu$ from all values in $x$. 
(X) First, substract the mean $\mu$ from all values in $x$. Then, divide the values by the standard deviation $\sigma$.


?: You have an apple whose mass is 120 grams. You can assume that the mass of apples is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ equal to 90 grams and standard deviation $\sigma$ equal to 15 grams. How many standard deviations away from the mean is the mass of your apple?  

(X) An apple with mass 120 grams is 2 standard deviations away from the mean.
( ) An apple with mass 120 grams is 30 standard deviations away from the mean.
( ) An apple with mass 120 grams is 8 standard deviations away from the mean.
( ) An apple with mass 120 grams is -2 standard deviations away from the mean.
