# Statistical Distributions

While we recommend using Python to find the answers to these questions, it is not required. You are more than welcome to use a calculator or pencil and paper to solve them, too.

[ ] The standard normal distribution is not symmetric around the mean.
[X] The mean, median, and mode of a standard normal distribution are equal.

?: Which of the following statements about samples and populations are true?

[X] A representative sample accurately represents the population.
[ ] The numbers you obtain when using a population are called statistics.
[ ] The numbers you obtain when using a sample are called parameters.
[X] A random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance.

?: What steps do you need to take to standardize a normally distributed variable $x$ with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$?

( ) First, divide all values in $x$ by the standard deviation $\sigma$. Then, substract the mean $\mu$ from all values.
(X) First, substract the mean $\mu$ from all values in $x$. Then, divide the values by the standard deviation $\sigma$.
